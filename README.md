# Modern XCOM2 Launcher (MXL)

This is a WIP port of [Alternative Mod Launcher ](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/xcom2-launcher) (which is a WinForms application)
to a more modern platform (AvaloniaUI). It's also a first experience with desktop GUI development for me so don't expect results
any time soon :)

Planned improvements over AML:

* Dark mode option
* High DPI support
* Cross platform (support for mac/linux versions of the game)
* No dependency on steamworks (no hacks required for GOG/EGS players)
* Popout config editor (with ability to have multiple windows/tabs)
* Overall cleaner code to improve maintainability and simplify adding new features 

At the moment there are no plans for when (if ever) a usable version will be ready.
